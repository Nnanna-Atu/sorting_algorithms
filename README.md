# Sorting Algorithms Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing and understanding different sorting algorithms in the C programming language. The primary goal is to gain proficiency in sorting algorithms, analyze their time complexities using Big O notation, and select the most suitable algorithm for specific inputs.

## Learning Objectives
1. Implement at least four different sorting algorithms.
2. Explain the concept of Big O notation and evaluate the time complexity of an algorithm.
3. Select the best sorting algorithm for a given input.
4. Understand what constitutes a stable sorting algorithm.
